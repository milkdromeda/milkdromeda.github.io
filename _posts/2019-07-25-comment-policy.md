The TOPS Repository contains a DISQUS comment section at the bottom of every resource. It is meant to act as a mini Q&A forum and allow friendly interactions between viewers. Please follow to the following guidelines when writing your comment.

## Keep it civil
- Criticize ideas, not people
- Choose your words wisely (no profanity intended to insult)
- No personal attacks

## Keep it tidy
- Make sure your comment relates to the page's resource

## Keep it meaningful
- While not strictly a guideline, your comment should add value to the discussion, such as by:
  - Asking a question
  - Answering to a question
  - Giving feedback to the author
  - Adding on to the contents of the resource

Now you know the rules, go out and explore the Repository! TOPS is yours to conquer.
