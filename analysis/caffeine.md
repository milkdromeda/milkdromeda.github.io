# Caffeine
December 2, 2019

## Facts
- Charter originally strictly prohibits all caffeinated drinks
- Tea is also a caffeinated drink
- The purpose of the infringement is to make a distinction for tea form other caffeinated drinks
    - Only applies to tea
- Note: s. 7 (6) requires carrying out the proceedings of subsection 5
    - But it is an if statement, and it does not apply in this case

## Question
Is the amendment of s. 12(2) a reasonable limit of s. 7(2) of the Charter?

## Test
1. Is the purpose of the infringement pressing and substantial?

Yes. Caffeinated drinks includes coffee, coke and tea. For the latter, it is often the only option at Chinese restaurants. As a significant beverage offered exclusively at these locations and considering the ancient tea culture of Asia, it becomes a relevant and substantial topic. The next beverage above tea would be water. Thus, clarifying the difference of tea from other caffeinated drinks is pressing and substantial.

2. Proportionality

a) Is the infringement rationally connected to its purpose?

Yes. Amending s. 12(2) would directly clarify its difference.

b) Does the infringement minimally impair the Charter right?

Yes. The amendment only make slight changes for tea, not other drinks. Coffee, coke and root beer, for example, would still be strictly prohibited.

The amendment will also only affect s. 7(4-6).

c) Do the positive effects of the infringement outweigh the negative effects of the loss of the Charter right?

Yes. Positive effects include a beverage to drink at some Chinese restaurants. The negative effects of the violation to s. 12 (2) is observed only within s. 7(4-6).

## Decision

Yes.

## Ratio Decidendi
Tea is distinct from other caffeinated drinks in its location and nature if served. However, it is still an addictive substance due to caffeine.

Dissenting opinion:
Because the purpose of the amendment is not pressing nor substantial, it does not past the Oakes test. This is due to the fact that the categorization of tea, coke and other substances are irrelevant for the goal of prohibiting addictive substances.

## Section Change
Old: The consumption of any forms of addictive substances and drugs are strictly prohibited. This includes caffeinated drinks, alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana etc.

New: The consumption of any forms of addictive substances and drugs are strictly prohibited. This includes caffeinated drinks other than tea, alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana etc. The consumption of tea is strongly not recommended unless it is the only beverage available or it is offered in a setting that seeks to appreciate the ancient tea culture of Asia.
